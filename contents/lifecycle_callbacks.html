        <h2>Lifecycle Callbacks</h2>

        <p>
            Both The <b>StatefulWidget</b> and <b>StatelessWidget</b> have three major lifecycle callbacks:
        </p>
    </section>

    <div class="code">
        <code>
    StatefulWidget({
        onBeforeMount: () => console.log('Widget will soon mount'),
        
        onMount: () => console.log('Widget has Mounted'),

        onDestroy: () => console.log('Widget has been destroyed'),
    })
        </code>
    </div>

    <section>
        <h1>onBeforeMount</h1>

        <p>
            This callback is ran before the widget is mounted on the DOM. If your widget depends on data from an external source, you can fetch those data in this callback.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>onMount</h1>

        <p>
            This callback is ran immediately after the widget is mounted on the DOM.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>onDestroy</h1>

        <p>
            This callback is ran immediately after the widget is removed from the DOM.
        </p>
