        <h2>Transitions</h2>

        <p>
            Since you've been going through the docs, you might have noticed the way content slides in when you go from one chapter to another.
            This is possible with what we call a <span class="highlight-primary">TransitionFunction</span> in plug.
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <code>

    export function scaleIn(options) {

        let duration = options?.duration || 1000

        let delay = options?.duration || 0

        return () => {

            return {
                delay,
                duration,
                from: {
                    opacity: 0,
                    transform: `scale(0)`
                },
                to: {
                    opacity: 1
                    transform: `scale(1)`
                },
                exit:{
                    opacity: 0,
                    transform: `scale(0)`
                }
            }
        }
    }
            </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the above code, the function <b>scaleIn</b> takes in <span class="highlight-primary">TransitionOptions</span> and returns a <b>TransitionFunction</b>, then the <b>TransitionFunction</b> returns a <span class="highlight-primary">TransitionConfig</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <b>TransitionFunction</b> can optionally take in a <b>node</b> in case you want to get the original styles of that node for your transition, example below:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <code>
    export function fade(options) {

        let duration = options?.duration || 1000

        let delay = options?.duration || 0
    
        return (node) => {

            const style = getComputedStyle(node)
    
            return {
                delay,
                duration,
                from: {
                    opacity: 0
                },
                to: {
                    opacity: style.opacity
                },
                exit:{
                    opacity: 0
                }
            }
        }
    }
            </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            The <b>TransitionConfig</b> has some fields in it: <br>

            <b>delay</b>: the number of milliseconds to wait before the transition starts. <br>
            <b>duration</b>: how long the transition should run in milliseconds. <br>
            <b>from</b>: describes the state from which the transition would start. <br>
            <b>to</b>: describes the target state at which the transition would end. <br>
            <b>exit</b>: the state at which the transition would go to before the widget is destroyed.
        </p>

        <h2>Using Transitions</h2>

        <p>
            You can use a transition on a widget by passing the desired transition to the <b>transition</b> field of the widget's config:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <code>
    Text('Hi mom' , { transition: fade() })
            </code>
        </div>

        <p>
            Now the Text widget in the code above would run the <b>fade</b> transition when mounted.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            <p>üìù</p>

            <p>Make sure you call your transition function when passing it to a widget,</p>

            <p>like this üëâ <b>"fade()"</b></p>
        </div>
