    <p>When you open your <b>Counter.js</b> file in the <b>src/components/Counter</b> folder of your project, this is what you see:</p>
</section>


<div class="code">
    <code>   
    export default function Counter(){

    const count = stream(0)

    return StatefulComponent({
      
      listen: [ count ]
      
      body: Container({

        children: [
          
          Button(() => `${count.value} is count` , {
            onClick: () => count.value += 1
          })

        ]
      })
    })
    }
    </code>
</div>

<p>
    This might look a little "too much" at first but we are going to break this code into chunks and get to understand with each passing chapter.
