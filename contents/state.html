   <h2>State</h2>
   
   <p>
      In Plug, to create reactive state, we instantiate a variable with a stream and data of any choice as it's value;
   </p>
   
   <div class="code">
      <code>
   //a number stream
   const count = stream(0)
   
   //a text stream
   const text = stream('')
   
   //An Array stream
   const numbers = stream([1 , 2 ,3])
      </code>
   </div>

</section>    

<section>
   <p>
      In Plug, we refer to state as <span class="highlight-primary">stream</span> 
      because, we can have different components across different files <b><em>listen</em></b> 
      to the same state. streams can also be used as local state within a component. Example below:
   </p>

</section>

<div class="code">
   <code>

   const general_count = stream(0)
   
   function Component1(){
      
      const local_count = stream(0)
      
      return StatefulWidget({
         
         listen: [ general_count , local_count ]
         
         /* body of component */
      })
   }
   
   function Component2(){
      
      return StatefulWidget({
         
         listen: [ general_count ]
         
         /* body of component */
      })
   }
   </code>
</div>

<section>
   <p>
      In the example above, <b>Component1</b> will update it's UI whenever the <b>general_stream</b> or it's <b>local_stream</b> changes, because <b>Component1</b> is <b><em>listening</em></b> to both streams, while <b>Component2</b> will only updates it's UI when the <b>general_stream</b> changes since that is the only stream it is <b><em>listening</em></b> to.
   </p>

   <div class="note">
      <b>üìù</b>

      <p>A StatefulWidget will only run an update if one of the streams it is listening to changes.</p>
   </div>


   <h1>External Streams</h1>

   <p>
      We can also have streams in external files and import them for use in other files:
   </p>

   <div class="code">
      <code>
   //streams.js file
   
   export const global_count = stream(0)
      </code>
   </div>

   <p>
      In our component file, we can import this stream and use it:
   </p>

   <div class="code">
      <code>
   import global_count from './path-to-file/streams.js'
   
   export function Component(){
      
      return StatefulComponent({
         
         listen: [ global_count ],
         
         body: /*body of the component*/

      })
   }
      </code>
   </div>
</section>

<section>

   <h1>.value , .update & .subscribe</h1>

   <p>
      We can get and set the value of a stream by calling <span class="highlight-primary">.value</span> on that stream
   </p>

   <div class="code">
      <code>
   const count = stream(0)
   
   console.log(count.value) //Logs 0 to the console
   
   count.value += 1
   
   console.log(count.value) //Logs 1 to the console
      </code>
   </div>

   <p>
      We can update a stream based on it's previous value by calling the <span class="highlight-primary">.update</span> method on it.
   </p>

   <div class="code">
      <code>
   //previous code...
   
   count.update(prevCount => prevCount * 2)
   
   //Logs 2 to the console.
   console.log(count.value)
      </code>
   </div>

   <p>

      streams can also be subscribed to
      by calling the <span class="highlight-primary">.subscribe</span>
      method on the stream.
   </p>

   <div class="code">
      <code>
   count.subscribe((new_value) => {
      console.log('count has changed')

      console.log(new_value)
   })
      </code>
   </div>

   <p>
      the <b>.subscribe</b> method of a stream takes in a callback function with the new value of the stream as a parameter and
      returns an unsubscribe function that can be called when a Component is destroyed.
   </p>
