    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Plug JS is a <span class="highlight-primary">'Pure'</span> , Single Page JavaScript framework, unlike other
      JavaScript frameworks that have some fancy compiler, Plug depends solely
      on our good old JavaScript functions. Apart from being
      <span class="highlight-primary">'fancy compiler free'</span> , Plug has a
      smaller package and bundle size ðŸ“¦. Considering the size of your
      <b>node_modules</b> folder, i think you'd love Plug ðŸ’–.

     <h2>Installation</h2>
   
     <p>Install <span class="highlight-primary">plug-cli</span> via npm.</p>
     
     <div class="note">$npm install plug-cli</div>
  </section>

  <p>
    After installing plug-cli, open your terminal in an empty directory and run the command below: 
  </p>

  <div class="note">$plug --new MyApp</div>

  <p>
    You can add the <span class="highlight-secondary">--ts</span> flag to the end of the above command if you want a TypeScript project instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Install all the dependencies by running the command below:
  </p>

  <div class="note">$npm install</div>

  <p>
    And this would give you a boilerplate plug project. With your terminal still
    open, run the command below to see your project in the browser:
  </p>

  <div class="note">$npm run dev</div>

  <p>Now that your project is ready, let's get "hands on ðŸ’»"</p>
